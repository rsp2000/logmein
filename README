AOR_SERVER
==========

This server reads a dump file of SIP registrations and listen on a TCP socket and can make lookup requests, responding with the corresponding JSON object after receiving an AOR (addressOfRecord) from the client.

Compilation:
------------
> make clean  (for cleanning)
> make        (for building)
 
 The binary is created on "bin" directory.
 
 Note: (1) for "debug" take off the comments on "#define _DEBUG" in aor_server.h file OR change the Makefile.
       (2) It uses the library JSMN for parsing JSON
 
Execution:
----------

> cd ./bin
> ./aor_server [<Port>]

 The server reads the file "regs.txt" on local directory and listen on "Port" provided as program parameter (default=5000)

 Note: (1) errors and debug messages are sent to screen
       (2) If a TCP connection is inactive for more than 10 seconds, the server closes it.
       (3) If an AOR cannot be found, the server returns an empty line.

      
Test:
-----
A Telnet can be used as a client TCP for testing. 
Ex.:
> telnet localhost 5000

For example, if a client sends:
0142e2fa3543cb32bf000100620002

The server will return:
